        <p>
          The term "fiduciary" is a legal and ethical standard of care that defines our relationship with you. It is a commitment we make without compromise. It means we are legally and ethically bound to act in your best interest at all times, even when it is not in our own. For us, it's more than just a legal requirement—it's the foundation of the clarity and simplicity we provide.
