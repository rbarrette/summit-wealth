        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          Saving for retirement is only half the journey. The true challenge—and where we provide the most clarity—is converting your complex nest egg into a simple, reliable stream of income that lasts a lifetime. We focus on tax-efficient distribution strategies that protect your wealth and allow you to enjoy the summit you've worked so hard to achieve.

            <h4 class="font-semibold text-2xl">How do I simplify Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)?</h4>
            <p class="leading-relaxed">RMDs can be complex, but the strategy can be simple. We help you consolidate accounts where possible and build a clear calendar for distributions, often automating the process to ensure you never miss a deadline. We also analyze strategies like Qualified Charitable Distributions (QCDs) to potentially reduce your taxable income while satisfying your RMD obligations.</p>

            <h4 class="font-semibold text-2xl">What is the most tax-efficient way to draw down my assets?</h4>
            <p class="leading-relaxed">The conventional wisdom isn't always the right answer for your specific situation. We create a clear hierarchy for your withdrawals, prioritizing assets in taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-free accounts based on a multi-year projection of your income needs and tax liabilities. The goal is simple: pay the least amount of tax legally required over the course of your retirement.</p>
